# Bank Customer Analysis: Data Wrangling & Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on data wrangling and visualization to analyze customer behavior in a banking context. By processing real-world financial data, we aim to uncover insights that can guide decision-making for a new banking startup. The dataset includes information about bank accounts, customers, transactions, loans, credit cards, and demographic details.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of several CSV files exported from a relational database, capturing account details, customer demographics, financial transactions, and loan histories. Key data sources include:

- **Accounts**: Account details such as opening date and statement frequency.
- **Clients**: Customer demographics and associated accounts.
- **Transactions**: Financial transactions categorized by type and purpose.
- **Loans**: Information on granted loans, including amounts and payment status.
- **Credit Cards**: Issued credit cards linked to accounts.
- **Payment Orders**: Bank transfer records initiated by customers.
- **Districts**: Regional demographic and economic indicators.

## Data Processing & Analysis
### 1. Data Wrangling
- Cleaning and restructuring the dataset to ensure tidy data format.
- Integrating multiple sources to create a unified analytical dataset at the account level.
- Extracting key financial and demographic features for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identifying trends in customer transactions and account behaviors.
- Analyzing loan repayment patterns and default risks.
- Visualizing financial activity and regional customer distributions.

## Key Deliverables
- **Processed datasets**: Cleaned and structured CSV files ready for analysis.
- **Analytical dataset**: A consolidated dataset for financial insights.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive and static charts to highlight key patterns.

## Technologies Used
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)** for data processing and visualization.
- **R (tidyverse, ggplot2)** for statistical analysis and alternative visualizations.
- **Quarto** for report generation and documentation.

## Potential Applications
- Customer segmentation for personalized banking services.
- Risk assessment models for loan approvals.
